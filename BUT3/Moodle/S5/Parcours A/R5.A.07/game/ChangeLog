All the changes are documented on the git history, so here's just the major ones

10-10-14 v2.3.0:
	* Gameplay: Now the game supports high score!
	* Development: Completely changed the source code
	               hierarchy. Its easier to add features now!

29-05-14 v2.2.3:
	* Development: Stopped distributing libiniparser's source
	               code along - now we expect the user to
	               install it as a dependency.

29-05-14 v2.2.2:
	* Gameplay: Added a button that allows rotating pieces by
	            180 degrees.
	* Bugs: Fixed a nasty bug that crashed the game randomly
	        during the Water animation.
	* Development: Removed entirely any C++11 features from the
	               codebase, thus making this game portable across
	               ancient compilers.

08-03-14 v2.0.1:
	* Bugs: Fixed this huge bug that prevented anyone from building
	        yetris if not cloned from a git repository.

13-02-14 v2.0.0:
	* Interface: Menus and Menu Items added. Now you can customize
	             settings in-game, along with the old way of editing
	             .ini files. Also, Pause Menu!
	* Interface: The Main Menu has two nice Animations, with way
	             more to come. It's a nice display of animated
	             ASCII-art with colors.
	* Gameplay: Game Profiles added! Now the settings are saved
	            to each user individually and one can change between
	            profiles easily.
	* Development: Completely reprogrammed the code to C++.
	               The game's way more flexible now - some features
	               would be unfeasable in plain old C.
	* Bugs: Fixed thousands of bugs introduced by myself when
	        converting to C++. So, in the end...
	* Downgrade: No high score support for now. It'll take
	             quite some time to make it and save according to
	             game profiles.
	* Downgrade: Scores are quite crippled, along with combos and
	             back-to-backs. They should be reimplemented soon.

26-01-14 v1.7.0:
	* Gameplay: blocks on the board can be pushed on all 4 directions.
	            options on the config file.
